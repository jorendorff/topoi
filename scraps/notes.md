Page 219 begins the listing of the BASIC program. It seems very simple,
mostly `PRINT` statements and `IF x THEN lineno`.

There are three programs in there.

Page 285 begins "Appendix C: Runs". I think there are three transcripts, maybe one per program.

The OCR'd text in the PDF is not useable:

Given a CFG, how can I find all "structured" subgraphs (that have a single entry and a single exit)?

Given a directed graph, how can I find all subgraphs with a single source and a single sink? (I'm allowed to delete the source's input edges and the sink's output edges.)

Something I did in manually refactoring the I7 code was turn goto edges into routines, and move the ending GOTO from the routine *up* into its users. Is that a matter of taste? Or are there good heuristics I can use...?
