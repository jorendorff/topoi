# TODO:
# - static checking:
#     - check that FOR/NEXT properly pair up in the CFG (assuming every branch is always possible)
#     - same for GOSUB/RETURN
#     - extend type checking to understand more values, ranges, integerness
#     - definite assignment analysis
# - CFG analysis
#     - separate CFG for each subroutine
#     - implement FOR/NEXT properly
# - interpreter output:
#     - track characters printed per line, to support the very wide tabs in the original
#     - tracing output should interfere less with print
#         - use output_column to cope with tracing output in the middle of a line
#     - tracing output in a different color
# - inform output:
#     - find all subroutines and split those with multiple entry-points to use tail calls
