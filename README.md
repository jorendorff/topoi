# Aristotle's Topics

You may be wondering, what are Aristotle's topics? And why should I care?

                  I'M GLAD YOU ASKED, JASON.  BRIEFLY, THE TWENTY-EIGHT
    ENTHYMEME TOPICS HELP A WRITER (OR A SPEAKER) DISCOVER
    SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS ABOUT SUBJECTS.

                  IN HIS 'RHETORIC', ARISTOTLE TELLS US THAT THE AIM OR GOAL
    OF RHETORIC IS TO PERSUADE AN AUDIENCE.  REMEMBER THAT TERM --
    PERSUADE.

                  ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT IF HIS STUDENTS IN THE
    ACADEMY KNEW AND PRACTICED USING THE TOPICS, THEY WOULD BECOME
    EFFECTIVE 'PERSUADERS.'

                  YOU'LL RECOGNIZE AMONG THE TOPICS:

                  1.  QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION;
                  2.  QUESTIONS ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS;
                  3.  QUESTIONS REGARDING OPPOSITES AND ASSOCIATIONS;
                  4.  QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSEQUENCES;
                  5.  AND QUESTIONS ABOUT MATTERS OF FACT AND OPINION.

For example, if you run this program and tell it you're interested in writing about `SMELLY REPTILES`, it might ask you:

    HOW DOES TIME AFFECT SMELLY REPTILES?

Or:

    WHAT SPECIAL EXPERIENCES MADE YOU SELECT
    SMELLY REPTILES AS YOUR TOPIC?
